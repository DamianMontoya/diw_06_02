00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, good day everyone. I am DamiÃ¡n Montoya, a Web Application Design student at the Estella Polytechnic.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500
In this tutorial video, I will present Vida con Patitas.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
A website developed within the Web Interface Design module.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.500
The main purpose is to facilitate pet adoption, acting as a bridge between animals looking for a home

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
and people interested in adopting responsibly and consciously.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.500
The first contact with the platform is the login.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
It shows the name along with the slogan.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Here, we can log in or register in case we don't have an account.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Through this button, it takes us to the relevant form where we need to fill in the username, email,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.500
and password, then click to create an account. In this case, we will proceed without an account.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.500
This takes us to the main page where we have the animal section.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:01:10.500
With the list of all animals available for adoption, along with a brief description of each one.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:01:15.500
The name, breed, age, shelter, and personality.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.500
At the bottom, we have two buttons, one to like and another to share.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.500
On the left, we have a filter panel that allows us to filter the search according to our preferences.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.500
If we wish to search for a large dog, we apply the filter, and it will show us the corresponding animals.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Additionally, if we click on an animal, it will take us to the detailed list of that animal.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.500
In this case, for example, we select Max.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.500
On this page, we have all the details of the selected animal.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:08.500
It includes age, size, likes and dislikes, along with a button that will take us to the contact page to adopt it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:22.500
On this page, we can fill in the form. In this case, for example, we want to adopt Max.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.500
And we send a message. Of course, the forms are validated.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.500
We click on "send message," and a message confirming the successful action appears.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.500
On the right side, we have the contact details: phone, address, and email.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.500
So we can contact the animal center directly.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.500
At the bottom, the social media of this project.
